# MRIpy
MRI tools with python/fenics

## TODO
1. "0D" solver for Bloch equation: simulate magnetization of for one group of nuclear spins within a rotating frame of reference for variable pulse sequences
2. FEM implementation of 2 & 3D Bloch equation using fenics
3. FEM framework for phase-contrast MRI with fluid flow
